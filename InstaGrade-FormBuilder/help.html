<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>My scans are innacurate, or images of them are blurry. What can I do?</dt>
	<dd>A couple things:
		<ul>
			<li>Scan in bright, even light, without shadows. If you see a lightning bolt in the top-left corner of your screen during scanning, use that to turn on the flashlight.</li>
			<li>Make sure quizzes aren't creased, folded or curved.</li>
			<li>Make sure there aren't any stray marks on the page.</li>
			<li>Hold the scanner in front of the page for a little longer. InstaGrade tries to capture the least-blurry image it can, so the longer you let it scan a page, the more likely you are to get a non-blurry image.
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>What can I do with the results of a quiz?</dt>
	<dd>
		Right now, you can view individual quiz results in the app, or visit our website for more in-depth analysis, including downloading an Excel file containing results. If you have a specific format you'd like to export to, or a web service you'd like us to upload to automatically, please <a href='/support'>leave feedback.</a>
	</dd>
	
   <dt>Can I create quizzes that are multiple pages?</dt>
	<dd>Sure. We'll just ask you to scan pages in order.</dd>
   
   <dt>I used the old InstaGrade app (with the red icon). Can I still scan my old answer sheets?</dt>
   <dd>
      Yes, but not with this app. In the App Store, find the "Purchased" list under the "Updates" tab â€” you'll be able to re-download the old app.
   </dd>
   
   <dt>I'm hearing a camera-shutter sound while using scanning. What's going on?</dt>
   <dd>
      iOS requires apps to play the shutter sound whenever they capture images from the camera. In most countries, you can silence this by switching your phone to Silent.
   </dd>
   
	<dt>I have an issue or question not mentioned here.</dt>
