	<dt>What devices does InstaGrade work on?</dt>
	<dd>InstaGrade works on any <strong>iPhone</strong> that runs iOS 7. It also works on the <strong>fifth-generation iPod touch</strong> (released October 2012) or later. We've tested InstaGrade on iPads, but their lower camera quality and lack of flash meant scanning accuracy wasn't up to par.</dd>
	<dt>How many questions can I have?</dt>
	<dd>The 24-question answer sheet is free; you can permanently purchase a 56-question answer sheet for $1.99. Each question can have choices A-E.</dd>
	<dt>Can I score differently if students leave answers blank?</dt>
	<dd>Unfortunately, detecting blank answers would impact accuracy, so InstaGrade doesn't detect blank answers. Any questions you've given the answers for are assumed to be filled in.</dd>
	<dt>My school district has laws about student privacy. What happens with my data?</dt>
	<dd>InstaGrade doesn't ever store student information in the cloud, or on any web service&mdash;only on your phone. You're in complete control.</dd>
