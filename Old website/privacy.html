	<h1>Instagrade Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    When you grade quizzes with Instagrade, results are only stored on your phone, never sent to any web service. If you use iCloud to backup your device's data, Instagrade information may be backed up as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instagrade uses Google Analytics to collect anonymous, aggregated non-identifiable information about usage of the app. Some examples of information we collect are the number of people who use the app daily. We never transmit information that could reveal student or teacher information.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use Crashlytics to track our app's crashes so we can fix them. These do not typically contain sensitive information, but we regard them as confidential nonetheless.
