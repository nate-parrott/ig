==============

By Karl Stenerud

### A better reachability for a modern age.


Introduction
------------

A long time ago in an Xcode far away, Apple provided "Reachability", an example Objective-C wrapper to demonstrate the SystemConfiguration Reachability APIs. On the whole it works well enough, but it could be so much more!

KSReachability takes reachability to the next level.


Features
--------

- Reachability to the network in general, to a host, or to an IPV4 or IPV6 address.
- Notifications/callbacks via NSNotification, blocks, and KVO.
- Fetching status values doesn't block.
- Callbacks and KVO always occur on the main thread, so it's UI-safe.
- KSReachableOperation: A one-shot operation to perform when reachability is established.
- Supports iOS and Mac OS X.
- Can be built with or without ARC, in CLANG or GCC.

Usage
-----

#### Import:
    #import "KSReachability.h"

#### Create a KSReachability object:
    self.reachability = [KSReachability reachabilityToHost:hostname];

#### Use blocks:
    self.reachability.onReachabilityChanged = ^(KSReachability* reachability)
    {
        NSLog(@"Reachability changed to %d (blocks)", reachability.reachable);
    };

#### Or use NSNotifications:
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
                                             selector:@selector(onReachabilityChanged:)
                                                 name:kDefaultNetworkReachabilityChangedNotification
                                               object:nil];
    ...

    self.reachability.notificationName = kDefaultNetworkReachabilityChangedNotification;
    ...

    - (void) onReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification*) notification
    {
        KSReachability* reachability = (KSReachability*)notification.object;
        NSLog(@"Reachability changed to %d (NSNotification)", reachability.reachable);
    }

#### Or use KVO:
    [self.reachability addObserver:self
                        forKeyPath:@"reachable"
                           options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew
                           context:NULL];
    ...

    - (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath
                          ofObject:(id)object
                            change:(NSDictionary *)change
                           context:(void *)context
    {
        KSReachability* reachability = (KSReachability*)object;
        NSLog(@"Reachability changed to %d (KVO)", reachability.reachable);
    }

#### Add a reachable operation:
    // Create a one-shot operation that gets fired once the host is reachable.
    self.reachableOperation = [KSReachableOperation operationWithHost:hostname
                                                            allowWWAN:NO
                                                                block:^
                               {
                                   [self showAlertWithTitle:@"One-time message"
                                                    message:@"Host is reachable!"];
                               }];

Caveats
-------

### The Meaning of Reachability

As per [Apple's SCNetworkReachability documentation](https://developer.apple.com/LIBRARY/IOS/documentation/SystemConfiguration/Reference/SCNetworkReachabilityRef/Reference/reference.html), a remote host is considered reachable when a data packet addressed to that host **can leave the local device** (i.e. the host is **theoretically** reachable). It does **NOT** guarantee that data will actually be received by the host or that the host will respond to a connection request! For example, if the host has a DNS record, but the host itself is down, it will **still** be considered **reachable**.

### Delays Due to DNS Lookups

KSReachability must do a DNS lookup to determine reachability to a host by name. Since this lookup can take upwards of 10 seconds in extreme cases, it is performed in the background. As a consequence, a newly created KSReachability object will always have its state set to unreachable until this lookup completes. If you need the true reachability to a host, you must wait for the "initialized" property to change to YES (it supports KVO). As an alternative, you can set the callback "onInitializationComplete".


Full Example
------------

I've included a full example project in this repository.

In **iOSReachability**, see **ViewController.h** and **ViewController.m** for details.

In **MacReachability**, see **AppDelegate.h** and **AppDelegate.m** for details.

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
